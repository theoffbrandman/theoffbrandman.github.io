                    <div class = "title"><h1>Blog Post #1 - My Introducation to Attack on Titan!</h1></div>
                    <p>Today, I started watching the anime series “Attack on Titan.” The fandom is huge, contains people with all different backgrounds and interests, and, most influential to my start of this journey, includes a large sum of my friends. I started where anyone would and should, with the first episode of the first season. It left me with many questions, not quite enough answers, and already an allegiance to the show. I’ll run through a quick summary of what I saw, noticed, and felt.</p>
                    <p>Opening scene, I was immediately struck by the art. It was clean and detailed, yet mellow and somber. It depicted the green eye of what seems to be the main character, Eren, then switched to some geese flying overhead. Eventually, we pan to a massive, terrifying creature, known as a titan. It looks like a messed up, Halloween version of the human musculoskeletal system. We watch it try to break past the walls that surround the city in which the characters live in. Cut to Eren having a bad dream. He wakes up in a flower field, crying, and here we meet Mikasa, a girl about his same age. They were collecting kindling before Eren fell asleep. They begin the walk back to the walls, in which their village is contained. Mikasa tells Eren to tell his father about the fact that he was crying when he woke up, but Eren absolutely refuses, wanting to put up a strong front, a theme we see continued throughout the episode. The children get to the gate and come upon the soldiers in charge of protecting it, drinking and playing cards. This sets Eren off, and he starts arguing with them, saying they should do their job properly. He then begins talking about how the citizens of Shiganshina (the city in which AoT is set) live like livestock, cooped up for their entire lives, and how they should explore and see what’s out there more thoroughly. At this point, it is revealed that Eren wants to join the scout regiment, a group that does just that, but experiences many casualties. Our next scene is of the said scout regiment returning to town. Many are injured, hurt, or missing. A mother runs into the crowd, asking for her son. They hand her a severed arm, as it is all that is left. The rest of her son has been eaten by a titan. Here we learn that the purpose of the scout regiment is to do research outside of the walls, but they tend to be generally unsuccessful, and end up being mocked by the majority of the village. Some people in the back of the crowd begin to say disparaging things about the scouts, causing Eren to hit them with a piece of kindling. Eren is a frail child, though, so this does nothing but anger them. Mikasa, who seems very strong, drags Eren away before he gets beaten up.</p>
                    <p>Now, the children are at home. We get to meet their mother and father, and see a calm, quiet, comfortable family life. That is, until Mikasa informs everyone of Eren’s intent to join the scout regiment. His mother begins to yell at him, equal parts furious and desperate for him not to. His father, a well-established doctor within the town, keeps a cool head, and talks with Eren about his motivations. The father then leaves for a business trip, stating he will return in a few days, and that he’ll show Eren what he’s been working on in the cellar, to which Eren lights up. His father then leaves, and immediately Eren’s mother tells him he is not allowed to join the regiment. He yells at her and runs away. The mother then tells Mikasa to look after him, and Mikasa begins pursuit. Suddenly, the episode cuts to a blond boy by the name of Armin. He is getting pummeled for apparently stating some sacrilegious ideas, likely about leaving the walls. He refuses to hit back, as to not stoop to his attacker’s level. He lets them know this, and that only makes them angrier. As he is about to get hit again, Eren shows up, screaming. Armin’s assailants turn to him, with recognition, and look excited to beat him up as well. They see Mikasa in tail, though, and comedically turn and run. After things are sorted out, we see the children at the river, where Eren and Armin discuss what’s beyond the walls, annoying Mikasa. They talk about their worries, wondering if there will be a breakthrough, or some terrible event. Foreshadowing. A huge bolt of lightning and an explosion just outside of the gate. A massive titan, taller than the walls, appears, and kicks a hole clear through the defenses. Rocks fly, buildings fall, and there are various bloody, gory casualties. Terrified and dreadfully hopeful, Eren and Mikasa run home to see if their mother is alright. Armin is left behind. Eren turns the corner, and sees his house, destroyed. His mother is trapped under a beam, legs crushed, and the children cannot free her. She tells them to run, but they won’t. Suddenly, a soldier shows up. His name is Hannes, the same one who was drunk at the gate. The mother tells him to take the kids and run, but he refuses, saying he’ll kill the titan that is currently coming for the family, and save them all, speaking of some sort of unpaid debt. He runs toward the monster, drawing his sword, but is stopped short. In an incredibly well animated scene, we see the titan turn to look at him. It is truly a terrifying creature. Hannes sheathes his sword, and doubles back. He grabs the children and takes them away. The mother thanks him, but, as she watches the children go, cries, covers her mouth, and says “don’t go.” Character backstory time. Eren turns back to look at his mother, and watches the titan pick her up, kill her, and bite her in half. We close on a scene of cloudy skies, with petals and puddles of blood floating across it in slow motion. The credits play, with a dark video and a somber song.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the first episode was awesome. All this, crammed into 22 minutes. Incredible animation, diverse characters, a great balance between action, gore, and blood, and philosophy, family, and childhood. I can’t wait for episode two. It really lived up to, and even blew past, my expectations. The show is deep, intricate, and entertaining. I’m full of questions, but in a positive way that keeps me interested. My only qualm with it is how some parts seemed forced. It all happened so fast, and parts of the dialogue didn’t seem normal, as if they were forcing character names in, or random facts about the city, plot, or background. Honestly, though, this is to be expected with any show in its early developmental stages, so it didn’t bug me too much. Details must be established, so let’s get it over with and get into the show! I can’t decide if I enjoy Eren and his persistence, or if I despise him and his holier-than-thou, righteous attitude. Mikasa is awesome and level-headed though. I look forward to the next episode, and the next 3 seasons too. Until next week!</p>

                    <p>The second episode continues in a similar fashion. A somber, gory tone, filled with death and despair. We see the children whisked away to an inner wall on the boat, and many people are left behind. There are crazed people, running through the city, getting eaten, shouting prayers, or simply giving up. We see many soldiers desert their positions. They try and keep the original titan that broke in from continuing to breach barriers by closing a gate, but the titan simply gets a running start and blows through the wall, allowing all the smaller titans in. The large one does not seem to be interested in eating people, but only in making way for the smaller titans to wreak havoc. In the mess, approximately 10,000 lives are lost, and a famine is created by all the refugees. The refugees are disliked by the people living in the area, and the next year, 250,000 are sent off to war. Only a few hundred return, essentially wiping out half of the region’s population. It is a depressing fact, but it solves the food crisis. Armin’s grandfather dies in the war, leaving all three children with no family. I am not entirely sure about what happened to the father, other than the fact that Eren now has the key to the basement and has some strange flashback about begging his father not to inject him with something. In the end of the episode, we see Eren tell Armin and Mikasa that he will be entering Cadet training for the army. Armin says he will too, and Mikasa says she’ll join to protect Eren and make sure he survives.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the show is both dystopian, set in a world completely different from ours, but also very familiar, exploring themes of hunger, strife, war, starvation, and refugee relations. It is both difficult to watch, and impossible to look away from. Continuing these blog posts, I will most likely begin to comment on three to four episodes at a time, as pausing the episodes and tearing myself away to take notes is proving to be much too difficult. It seems, though, that the characters, plot motivation, and overall tone of the show have been set in this two-part episode, so I expect there will be less details to nitpick over in the coming episodes. I can’t wait to continue watching!</p>

                    <div class = "title"><h1>Blog Post #3 - Episodes 3-6: Madness</h1></div>
                    <p>For this week’s blog, I watched episodes 3 through 6 of the first season. Let me start by saying this: it was insane. The story moved along at a break-neck pace yet was also just perfectly slow enough to add in all the necessary details, stylistic elements, and character development. In the 4 episodes, we are introduced to an assortment of new characters, and soon afterward watch many of them get brutally murdered. We watch Eren, Mikasa, and Armin make their way through Cadet training, a training which Eren almost fails, until he realizes that he has been given faulty equipment to try and pass the exams. He makes it through in the top 5 in his class, with Mikasa in first place, and him in fifth. Armin seems to be somewhere in the top twenty, but we are not specifically told anything. The day after graduation, the colossal titan returns to knock down another wall. “Out of the frying pan, into the fire,” one character can be seen saying. It shows up, kicks a hole where the gate is, and right as Eren is heading towards the back of his neck to kill him, vanishes entirely. The episode goes on, and we see many of the cadets get murdered, grabbed right out of the air and eaten. Eren gets his leg bitten off while flying through the city, and lands on a rooftop, seemingly unable to move. Armin, at this sight, is petrified, and a titan picks him up, swallowing him whole. Eren manages to get back up, and, after a flashback about plans of seeing the outside world together with Armin, pries the mouth of the titan open. He pulls Eren out, and is promptly chomped down on by the titan, where we see his arm gruesomely fly off, the only thing that was outside of the titan’s jawline. Madness. Overall, though, the show is awesomely constructed. The development of characters is both deep and fast. The story has been explained, and shows a mixture of real-world fears and problems, along with whimsical fantasy elements. It is both gruesome and beautiful. It shows the close bonds between people, along with the delicate nature of life. One of the most important concepts the show incorporates is that of the fragility of the human mind. My favorite (yet also least favorite) character arc is between two recently graduated cadets who seem to have fallen deeply in love with each other. We watch them grow close, act sappy and childish, and progress in their military work. But, at some point, after Armin is pulled from the jaws of the titan by Eren, he comes upon the pair. The girl is desperately trying to give her lover CPR, but he simply won’t respond. Armin begs her to stop, but she won’t listen. The camera slowly cuts and pans, until the audience is allowed to indirectly realize that the man is missing the lower half of his body, entirely. This theme is a constant so far, as we watch various people fall into voids of despair and pits on insanity. Some are pulled from it by friends or fellow army-members. Some never make it out, and die, petrified before a titan, which proceeds to eat them. Here, and likely for the remainder of my blogging about the show, I will place a large emphasis on this concept. Most anime I have watched put the main characters in godlike positions, with unbreakable minds and unstoppable wills, completely ignoring the actual condition of the human mind. Attack on Titan’s portrayal about how easily humans can be broken, caused to struggle in helpless desperation over an impossible task, is serene, undisturbed, and unrivalled. It is one of the few productions that I have seen do such an incredible job at expressing a sensation that so many have felt yet is so often thrown to the curb in cinema. Astonishingly twisted, yet brutally accurate. I am simultaneously excited and terrified to continue watching, but I know I won’t be able to peel myself from it until the very end.</p>

                    <div class = "title"><h1>Blog Post #4 - Episodes 7-11: The Battle of Trost</h1></div>
                    <p>As I continue watching Attack on Titan, I notice that its structure revolves around parts that neatly confine specific story arcs to various events, such as battles, backstories, or summaries. For instance, the show starts with a short, 2-part arc, introducing the characters and their stories, along with the world and the titan attacks. They then hold another arc, which constitutes cadet training and graduation. This transitions into a 9-episode arc, named “The Battle of Trost,” with Trost being a city that has been broken into by the colossal Titan once again, in the same way that was done to Eren, Mikasa, and Armin’s home city. The Trost arc, as I will call it, begins curiously. The cadets, now graduated, must fight off a horrific invasion right out of training. Many of them die almost immediately. There is a rally of courage on the rooftops, where the show draws on a very common anime trope that goes something like this: characters down on their luck, losing badly, main character gives heroic, motivational speech that inspires everyone, as speech ends, epic music begins to play, the crowd heads out, and in an incredibly awesome montage, the characters fight back, stronger than before, and come out victorious. However, if there is anything I have learned in the few episodes of AoT that I have watched, this seems unlikely, and how right I was. The characters get no more than one minute into their grand fight scene when they start getting brutally grabbed from the rooftops or yanked from the cables which they use to swing around and are brutally torn to shreds and eaten. This is around the point at which I left off last time, with Eren saving Armin and getting eaten, but I had to summarize what I previously watched to emphasize the organization of the show, along with the brutal rejections of the most common cliches and tropes of general anime. It was both bewildering and expected, at least knowing what I did as about the AoT fandom and their conversations about the matter. But as the arc carries on, we see a familiar theme, centered around, of course, our main character Eren.</p>
                    <p>Eren can transform into a titan. There, it’s out of the bag. Now to discuss it. This theme is a near constant in any anime that contains fighting, especially against a formidable opponent which the characters seem to have no chance of beating. It is the specific principle that, in the face of death or defeat, the main character suddenly gains some incredible power, usually from rage, spite, or sadness. In AoT, we see Eren freak out in the stomach of a titan and transform into one himself out of fear and rage. He goes on a rampage, killing as many other titans as he can, and helps the remaining soldiers retake the supply tower. Nobody realizes that it’s him though, only knowing that it is a titan with no interest in killing humans, but only hunts other titans, which is completely unheard of. They only discover it’s him when the titan seemingly runs out of energy, falls on its face, and, as it decays into steam (which is what titans do when they die), he sits up out of it. Mikasa rushes down to embrace him. To summarize the events that happen after this, we see Eren use his power to protect Armin and Mikasa when a canon is shot at the three for treason, as the unit commander believes Eren wants to kill everyone, and his friends are committing treason by protecting him. We see the Military General of the south walls, Pyxis, show up and put a stop to this. Eventually, a plan is hatched to have Eren seal up the wall in titan form by picking up and carrying a huge boulder and placing it into the hole that the colossal titan created. Once again, the show harps on the mental fragility of humans, showing depictions of people who do not want to fight a battle alongside a titan trying to desert. Some are told they will be killed for deserting and say they would prefer it to dying in battle. Some even try to commit suicide. Pyxis eventually gives a speech, causing many soldiers to change their minds and fight. When Eren transforms into a titan, though, we see him try to kill Mikasa. Armin snaps him out of it by reminding him what the future holds, along with stabbing him, and, after mass casualties, the hole is sealed. It is the first time the humans have ever won a battle against the titans, as opposed to suffering pointless casualties.</p>
                    <p>Looking back at these few episodes, and this blog post so far, I realize how much has been covered, and how much I have left out. The show moves at a truly incredible speed, yet fits in a fantastic amount of detail, with never a dull moment, yet never a moment misunderstood, either. The creators accept tropes, reject others, and have created a true masterpiece, worthy of a fandom as loyal as the one it has. I believe that the topic of my term paper on this anime will be something about mental health and the anime fandom, as it is generally a large issue among fans, but largely ignored by anime and the producers of such. And, to end this post with one final topic, I must talk about the happenings inside the gas resupply tower. Gas is needed for the soldiers to swing around on their mobility gear. The resupply room has been overtaken by titans, though, and the resupply workers gave up, leaving many soldiers out of gas and near death due to this. A look inside the resupply tower under siege tells a story. We see four remaining soldiers barricaded in a room. Three are freaking out, terrified of death, two men and two women. One, though, is calmly loading a shotgun. He finishes loading it, and one of the women freaking out turns to tell him that it won’t do anything to the titans. Without so much as a glance, he puts the barrel in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The camera immediately cuts to the woman who was just talking to him, and we see his blood splatter on her face, right before we cut back to the soldiers outside. It is a heavy scene. It is a lot to process, but, in a production such as AoT, a completely necessary depiction of the human mind at its simplest yet most complex level. Until next week.</p>

                    <div class = "title"><h1>Blog Post #5 - Episodes 12-18: Eve of the Counterattack and Female Titan</h1></div>
                    <p>Trost has been recaptured, and the first victory the humans have ever had over the titans is accomplished, despite many casualties. We see the characters recuperate, and, just as it is with real wars, they are launched into the next series of events. There is a dramatic ceremony where some are induced into the scout regiment, while others turn their back in fear and run away from the idea of a likely death. Pretty reasonable if you ask me. A counterattack is immediately launched, where the characters attempt to retake wall Maria, the wall first lost in the beginning of the series, where we see the death of Eren’s mother. They venture out into the ruins of the past city, and we see the complex system of signaling flares they use to evade titans while on horseback. We see how they bring down the monsters without the aid of large structures to assist them in getting higher ground, and how they prioritize certain sectors of the troops using formations and communications. Everything seems to be going much better in terms of killing titans than in the beginning of the show, with almost no deaths, thanks to the work of the highly trained veteran scouts. They even succeed at taking out some abnormal monsters, until we meet a new titan, the first one to express female characteristics. It destroys many and seems to tear through the ranks with little to no regard for the people trying to attack it, as if searching for someone. It also appears to have the rationality to cover the nape of its neck, its weak point. Armin is attacked by it, but when the female titan sees his face, he is sparred for some odd reason. And, by the way, the title of the episode is quite literally “Female Titan,” placing an interesting emphasis on the fact that all the titans we have seen previously are male, which I may talk about at some point later in the future. Armin begins to theorize that, like Eren and his titan form, the female titan is controlled by a person, which would explain its seemingly intelligent nature. We see this titan take out the entire right wing and, therefore, their recon and signaling capabilities, meaning no one else within the ranks is aware of its presence.</p>
                    <p>But this section of the season deals heavily in character introductions of non-titans too. Through Eren’s acceptance into the scout regiment, we meet a whole new crew of people who are thought to be some of the most advanced titan hunters in existence, only surpassed by Mikasa and the leader of the group, as far as we know. They seem to be a jovial bunch yet remain incredibly serious under battle conditions. The leader of the group, named Levi, seems to be quite the important figure, always keeping a level head, being quite analytical, yet also incredibly powerful and precise when it comes to killing titans and giving orders. We are also introduced to a scout member who works specifically with titans in terms of research and discovery, who talked to Eren briefly earlier in the series, but we were not given the chance to fully meet. She deals with captured titans, running various tests on them, seeing what affects them, how to hinder them, and various other things. Definitely, though, we are given a mad scientist depiction of her and her interactions with the titans she studies. She seems to harbor a deep care for them, screaming about the empathetic pain she feels when stabbing them with spears and various other things she must do in the name of research. One of the major developments within the story is when the two titans she is studying are killed by some unseen infiltrator. This causes her to break down and leads to an inspection of the battle equipment of every single person who could have possibly been involved.</p>
                    <p>I stopped watching at a tense point, but I look forward to the season finale. My next blog post will include the last episodes, for which I have no idea what to expect, other than cliffhangers. I can only imagine how the scout regiment will continue their journey, or who the person controlling the female titan will end up being. I am currently running through every blond female character in the show coming up with conspiracies and explanations. I look forward to the development of the new characters, and perhaps a discussion of gender representation so far in the series, between Mikasa, our newfound mad scientist, and the first-seen female titan. But then again, by the time I get around to my next blog post, they could each be dead, so no promises! Until next Sunday.</p>

                    <div class = "title"><h1>Blog Post #6 - Episodes 19-25: End of Season 1</h1></div>
                    <p>The end of the first season is upon us, and not without drama. Getting right back into where we left off, the female titan continues to wreak havoc. By this point, the general of the scout division, Erwin, has decided to take a turn through a thick forest to bolster the capabilities of the omni-directional mobility equipment, or ODMs, as the soldiers can now grapple between the massive trees. At this point, it has been made clear that the female titan’s goal has something to do with Eren. We see her chase Eren, Levi, and Levi’s team as they run on horseback. We watch as various other soldiers are mauled and murdered during the female titan’s pursuit, and Eren chooses to trust Erwin and allow this to continue for the sake of some plan that he cannot be told about. They lead the female titan into a trap and capture her by an intricate net of spears and cables shot into her body. However, they are unable to cut out the person inside due to the titan’s unprecedented ability to harden her skin, so it breaks the swords of the soldiers. In a grandiose escape, the female titan lets out a giant roar alerting other titans to her location. The other titans swarm the area and begin to tear her body apart. When the smoke of her decaying body clears, the operator is nowhere to be seen, until we realize there is a strange, new, hooded scout swinging through the forest. This new scout goes after Eren, and one of the members of Levi’s elite titan killing squad dies protecting Eren from the mysterious figure. Levi is, at this point in the story, separated from Eren and his squad, due to various orders from Erwin. The mysterious scout then transforms into the female titan and continues after Eren. The remaining members of Levi’s squad attempt to continue to protect Eren but are horrifyingly dispatched, one by one, as Eren watches. At the sight of this, Eren transforms into a titan himself and fights her. He loses and is swallowed by the female titan. She runs off with him in her mouth, but Levi and Mikasa give chase, eventually bringing her to a stop, cutting Eren out of her mouth, and, by Erwin’s orders, retreat home. The loses are major, and the success is minimal.</p>
                    <p>As our soldiers return home, we transition into the next arc, seeing a dismal reception from the village, and the orders that Eren must be turned over to the military police, likely for a death sentence. We see an incredibly intricate plan, though, hatched by Armin, our resident genius. A close friend takes Eren’s place in the guarded cab, and they recruit Annie, a military police officer and past friend from their group in cadet training, to assist. She says yes, and they lead her through an intricate passage to escape the city. She gets to the entrance of an underground tunnel, and for some reason, refuses to go any further. At this point, I connect the painfully obvious dots. Annie is female, blond, has incredible combat skills, placed very highly in her graduating class, and is almost definitely the female titan. They attempt to ambush her, but she turns into the female titan and begins trying to kill Eren, having seemingly given up on the idea of capturing him. After massive destruction, a failed escape attempt, and a near death experience, Eren is also able to transform into a titan and fight back. They are relatively evenly matched, until Eren unlocks a special ability, and literally heats up, turning black and orange. He begins to destroy Annie, and we see her try to escape by hardening her fingers and climbing the wall. Her face is, at this point, very disfigured, looking both terrifying and terrified. Mikasa meets her halfway, though, and, after an epic one-liner, cuts off Annie’s fingers, leaving her to fall back to Eren. Eren tears her to shreds, and nearly kills her, but stops short when he sees Annie’s actual face. In Eren’s split second of hesitation, Annie, who is having a continuous series of flashbacks about how she must return and see her father one last time, engulfs herself in a cocoon of the semi-translucent material that breaks swords. She is no longer in titan form, having been torn from it be Eren, and is simply laying in the shell wearing her military uniform, in a comatose state. This all transpires in the capital of the centermost wall and is witnessed by the highest echelons of society. As the final episode ends, we see a portion of the wall crumble where Annie had put her hand and broken through. Behind the portion, inside the wall, is the terrifying face of a titan. A painful cliffhanger.</p>
                    <p>This has been a huge summary, and I left out quite a lot for the sake of it being a summary, but I could not look away for a moment. I am so incredibly excited to begin the second season. To revisit my previous posts, I must reiterate the incredible depictions of the fragility of humans as a species that this show incorporates. It is revisited time and time again, each instance as meaningful as the last. Whether it be immobility from fear, unbridled rage after witnessing the death of close ones, or suicide as a means of escape from the all too painful future, there is no filter placed on the reality of the situation and the people in it, as is so often done with anime. Now, in terms of gender representation, the show does a curious job. For instance, in the manga, Mikasa is apparently given a personality that extends beyond Eren’s faithful bodyguard. She has a sense of humor, among other things, and many have a problem with her stoic animated version. I have yet to read the manga, but once I do, I plan to expand on this concept. On the other hand, one of the show’s first well-known major antagonists and plot twists is, and revolves around, Annie. She is a strong, independent, and terrifying woman, something that is not represented all too well across mainstream animation. She begins seemingly as a side character, but is given some thought-provoking depth and unknown motives, and becomes an incredibly important figure in the general plot. Another case to look at is Levi’s elite squad before they are wiped out. One of the four members is a young woman named Petra. She, like Annie, is incredibly good at what she does, having worked hard to get to where she is, and has a diverse and strong skillset. Unfortunately, like many of the other characters, she was never given the chance for character development.</p>
                    <p>As an update to my previous post, after looking at the wiki, I realize our mad scientist, named Hange, is apparently ambiguous in gender. The inclusion of a non-binary character is an important realization, and something I will also discuss in a future post. I ended up calling Hange by she/her pronouns in the previous blog post due to what I chalk up to an error in translation from Japanese audio to English subtitles. Perhaps the loss in translation from manga to anime, anime to subtitles, and subtitles to dubbing is another conversation I should consider blogging about in the future, but I will wait until Hange is given some more background and action. I will continue to do my best to avoid mistakes like these in the future and do some additional research into character backgrounds using the fandom wiki going forward. Until next season!</p>

                    <p>We are calmly placed back into the story with a scene of a book flipping through pages floating over a dark background, with embers floating through it. The episode centers around two main aspects, the first being the titan we saw in the wall at the ultimate close of the previous season. We learn that the walls are made of the same material that Annie uses when hardening her skin, created by the titans that reside within the walls. Most people had no idea of their existence, other than the members of the faith-based organization that keeps the walls at the center of their ideology, who also refuse to give up the least bit of information. The other dominant plot point takes place at some castle outpost, where scouts that are familiar with Eren are being watched, suspected to be titans. While there, a group of nine titans is spotted heading up from the south, leading the people at the camp to suspect that wall Rose has been breached. This would mean that only one wall remains, the smallest and innermost, and the concept terrifies the troops. A counterattack is launched, and the leader of the group runs ahead to a city as a distraction. He is highly experienced and seems to be largely successful in diverting and thinning the titans, until he meets a large, rectangular-framed, hairy titan. The episode title is beast titan, so this is what I will refer to it as. The beast titan catches the group leader and is not only able to command the titans around him, but also talks to the group leader. The leader is too scared to talk to the beast titan, who is inquiring about the ODM equipment, so the titan simply takes his gear and walks off. As the titan leaves, it tells the other titans that they are allowed to eat the man, and he dies. The beast titan introduces a whole new series of questions though, being the first titan to control other titans, the first to talk, and the first to have hair all over its body, like a monkey of some sort.</p>
                    <p>In this single episode, we are introduced to two new plot devices, both completely unprecedented, but aside from that, it feels as if there is no other change. The show falls right back into its groove, accurately depicting the gore and violence of the titans, yet the general themes are starting to feel overused, and character development is lacking. I will not harp on this too much though, as it is only the beginning of the season, but I do hope that the recuring principles which make the show so intriguing do not become a crutch that simply makes it different. I do look forward to the future episodes though, and perhaps as it was with the first few episodes of the first season, the producers could possibly be having a difficult time getting everything established. Looking forward to the next post!</p>

                    <p>I had only planned to watch one episode for this post but ended up getting just a *little* carried away. The plot twists that occurred were immense, and I had only expected one of them. In summary, three additional characters are titan-shifters (the official title of people who can transform into titans like Eren). The first we see is Ymir, who has obscure motives as the secret bodyguard of an illegitimate child of a royal family named Historia. A mouthful, one which has yet to be fully explained. From a scene with her in it, we can infer that there is a language only titans can read. The other two titan-shifters are Reiner and Bertholdt, two close friends, who grew up in the same area as Annie. They are the armored and colossal titans, respectively, the same ones who broke through two of the walls, killing many. I suspected Reiner to be the armored titan simply due to a similarity in appearance and build, along with a scene in which he appears to be crushed but somehow survives. We also see additional scenes of the Beast Titan, who can control other titans, where he convinces smaller titans to attack Ymir, Historia, Reiner, Bertholdt, and others, as they are trapped in a castle. Here is when Ymir shifts into titan form, to defend the group, and we see a prolonged struggle. Ymir wins, but incurs heavy bodily damage, though not enough to kill her due to her titan healing powers. From here, the scouts all regroup on top of wall Maria, which was thought to have a hole at the end of the previous episode I posted about, but is instead completely intact, leaving it a mystery as to how the titans got in. We are given subtle hints to the answer, and I have decided that the Beast Titan has some power that can transform normal humans into mindless titans. I will see if this theory holds in future episodes. From this point in the arc, though, the group is on top of the wall, and as they prepare to head home, Reiner, in a way that I can only describe as hilariously nonchalant, admits to Eren that he is the armored titan and Bertholdt is the colossal titan. From here, Mikasa attempts to kill them, but fails, which leads to an intense battle scene, the outcome of which is that Eren and Ymir are captured and taken away. The last episode I watched leaves Eren and Ymir, both missing and regrowing limbs, in the tall forest from the female titan arc, held captive by Reiner and Bertholdt, with the scouts in pursuit. Plenty of suspense, and a surplus of questions.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I would have to say that the second season of the show quickly regained footing and is right back where everything left off. It is certainly hard to believe that all questions will be answered and all things settled in just 2 and a half more seasons, but I look forward to the continued fast-paced and extreme narrative that the show supplies. I am also enjoying the development of what I thought to be supporting, side, or minimal characters into what are now main plot points with deep histories and complex motives. If anything, Eren has been relatively scarce so far, something I don’t mind, considering that anime productions tend to center around the main characters too much and leave the side characters to be forgotten. Overall, the second season so far is very well put together, and the fashion in which it is presented remains captivating, especially the art and attention to detail.</p>

                    <div class = "title"><h1>Blog Post #9 - Episodes 35-45: Even More I Guess</h1></div>
                    <p>I was a fool to think my last post was a whole lot of plot advancement. I should have known, watching 10 episodes of a show like this in one sitting, but my brain is officially fried. I blew right through the end of season 2 and ended up a third of the way through season 3. An incredible amount of stuff has happened, but the two major points are that a coup d’état has been staged and successfully carried out, and that we have been given some important backstory on how this world came to be. At the end of my last post, Eren and Ymir had been taken away by Reiner and Bertholdt. I was witness to the epic battle that ensued in the attempt of recapture the two. Many die, Erwin loses an arm, some questionable yet successful battle strategies are used, and Eren unlocks a new power, through which he can control other titans, save the titan shifters. We also find out that the mindless titans are human creations, just people injected with a certain serum, turned into human devouring monsters, a stunning revelation to the various scouts who have spent their lives hunting titans, just to find out they’ve really been hunting people. Apparently, some founding titan appeared many years ago, decided all of humanity should live within the walls, and erased everyone’s memories. This founding titan passed on its ability to erase minds, control and create titans, and do various other things we have yet to learn about. What we do know, though, is that this ability, like other titan abilities, is passed on through eating those who already have the ability. So Eren’s father eats the person who inherited the ability, stealing it from the royal bloodline, then has Eren eat him, so Eren now has the power of the founding titan. Historia, the illegitimate child from earlier, though, is the rightful heir of this power, but in a very dramatic scene, decides to let Eren keep it and go against her father’s wishes. Chaos ensues, the father drinks some titan serum, transforms into a giant monster, and, because all of this was happening in some huge underground cavern, Eren also drinks some titan serum and transforms, building a protective structure out of the special hardened titan skin we saw Annie with way back when to save himself and the people who came to rescue him. Wonder what ever did happen to Annie though. Apparently, she’s somewhere deep underground being experimented on, allegedly. As soon as the crew makes it out of the cave, Erwin informs Historia of the coup, and tells her that she is the next rightful Queen of the kingdom within the walls due to her bloodline. She takes the role, and where I leave off, the episode ends with the harrowing problem of Historia’s father approaching the walls in titan form, and how they are going to stop him from destroying the kingdom.</p>
                    <p>I must say, the transition between seasons 2 and 3 was much smoother than the beginning of the show or the transfer between seasons 1 and 2, so much so that I wouldn’t have even noticed it if it weren’t for the different title of the episodes. The show has found its groove, and I am saddened to think that I’m nearly halfway done. The character development is awesome, yet exceptionally fragile, with every episode seeming the possible end of everything that has been built up around any one person. The show is no stranger to death, and really sticks with its core themes. The characters experience realistic defeat, which results in triumphs that feel that much better, knowing from where they came, and that sacrifices were made to get there. It surely is heavy, but the realism of the show continues to strike me. And while I’m certainly not saying that it is a mold every animation should follow, it is a very welcome change of pace.</p>

                    <p>Almost there, too soon. I’m technically a quarter of the way through the final season, meaning halfway through what’s already been animated, coming up on what they’re still working on, the last half of the final season. It has been a journey. Last post, I left off at the attack of Rod Reiss, the massive titan, and the dilemma the scouts faced. Then I watched 20 episodes, finished season 3, and practically forgot it even happened. They ended up defeating him before he was able to get in the walls, and Historia is now the queen. Right after this victory, the scouts set out to retake wall Maria, the goal since season 1. The journey to get here has been so long, I almost forgot it. The scouts arrive, anticipating an attack, but reseal the inner gate with ease and no complications, using Eren’s new ability of hardening his skin. They fear a surprise attack, though, and delay the resealing of the outer gate. They find Reiner hiding within the walls, and a battle ensues. At some point during this, the scouts also end up surrounded within the city that lies between the sealed inner gate and the outer gate. The beast titan shows up, along with a ring of regular titans under his control. To murderously summarize, Reiner is almost killed, but survives, Bertholdt, through a distraction plan made by Armin and Eren, cooks Armin alive, but is cut from his titan. Simultaneously, Erwin, the leader of the scouts, also has a distraction plan for the beast titan, and leads all the remaining scout forces on a suicide charge into a deadly volley or rocks thrown by the beast titan. While this is happening, Levi sneaks up on him, and ends up slicing the beast titan to bits. The man inside the beast titan, though, manages to escape when another unknown titan shifter takes him away. Somehow, Erwin is still barely alive, but on the verge of death, and so is Armin. They can be saved if injected with titan serum and allowed to eat Bertholdt’s body, but only one can be saved, as there is only one shot, and only one dismembered Bertholdt. It is Levi’s decision, and through a heated struggle, he seems to choose Erwin, but as soon as everyone leaves the area to allow him to do it, he chooses Armin. Erwin is dead, Armin has the colossal titan, and many people are pissed. But they go to the basement and find that there is another civilization across the sea, beyond the walls, and this civilization is responsible for the oppression of the people within the walls, which are all apparently of the same race, the Eldians. At the end of season 3, we see Eren, Mikasa, and Armin make it to the sea, finally, but Eren kills the mood, talking about he must kill everyone on the other side.</p>
                    <p>Season 4 now. We see the first episodes of this through the eyes of people who live on the mainland, the civilization outside of the walls. They are the Marleyans, people of Marley, and because only the Eldians can become titans, they oppress the Eldians. They have much better technology, such as blimps, cars, photographs, and so on. They are currently fighting a war to colonize their mainland and use titan Eldians as weapons against other world leaders and their countries, either forcing the titan shifters to assist them, or injecting Eldians with titan serum to turn them into mindless titans to drop on the cities of the enemy. The beast titan also has the power to turn normal Eldians into mindless titans, which answers some questions from earlier. Either way, it’s been a few years since season 3, and a much older looking Eren sneaks into the army and ends up in a mental hospital under a secret identity. We learn many things about their society, but where I stopped watching, Eren turns into a titan at a theater production and kills most of the world leaders.</p>
                    <p>There’s a lot to unpack here. Basically though, it’s genocide. Reiner is the only one on his squad to return and is mentally unwell. Eren isn’t doing so well either and has grown his hair out. Many things are wrong, and interpersonal relationships seem to be falling apart. For the few moments we see him interact with Mikasa, he seems distant, more so than he always has been, ignoring a request for him to return home. And the worst part of it all, is that both sides are doing a terrible job of dealing with their newly defined enemies. Eren is blindly killing the Marleyans, and the Marleyans plan to blindly kill everyone within the walls. I ended up browsing some subreddits for a while, looking at what everyone thinks, and, through memes and discussion posts, the two biggest problems seem to be a) whether the ending is the worst thing ever to happen, or b) where blame should go for the various murders of characters. Overall, people seem to dislike Eren, and choose the sides of the Eldians that lived under the rule of the oppressive Marleyans. A general state of dissonance. But the best is made of it, and there is an assortment of hilarious videos poking fun at various groups and their claims, such as mocking overly intricate fan theories about how Armin grew half a foot between series, or that certain children are justified in killing certain long-standing supporting characters, something I have yet to witness, but has indubitably been spoiled for me through these memes. Another thing I found that related to the disagreement in the fandom over the ending was the variety of rewritings of Isayama’s work. Some simply recreate the ending, and some, in a more comical tone, show how the series could have ended in season 1 with a simple mistake. Overall, the show has been incredible to watch, and it is with both sadness and excitement that I begin the final few episodes of the animated series, knowing that there is less than a season left. I’m very glad though that I haven’t had to wait all 12 years of the manga’s production for this moment. That would have been miserable.</p>

                    <div class = "title"><h1>Blog Post #11 - Episodes 66-75: The Story Now</h1></div>
                    <p>Here I am at the end of the animation. Now to wait for approximately a month for the second half of the last season to be aired. I really can’t complain though, as I have yet to wait a moment for the release of an episode, starting at an incredibly convenient time. So, what has happened in these past 10 episodes? Eren’s plans have gone accordingly. Apparently, Zeke, Eren’s older brother, has some plan to euthanize all Eldians through Eren’s power, but Eren must be touching Zeke for it to happen. Most of the world leaders are dead, and Eren has gained the war hammer titan, which I referenced in a previous post, by eating the owner. The scouts originally had Eren locked up underground, but a resistance group called the Jeagerists, after Eren’s and Zeke’s last name, has overthrown the government. They did this by spiking the wine the army drinks so much of with Zeke’s spinal fluid. Once ingested, Zeke can then turn any person of Eldian descent into a mindless titan by yelling, meaning the entire army would be gone by one scream. During the part of the story where Eren is killing world leaders, Zeke gets captured and sent to the forest to be guarded by Levi and a group of soldiers. Zeke screams, though, and all the soldiers other than Levi turn into titans, as they have drunk the wine. Zeke believes this will be enough to stop Levi, but Levi kills his transformed comrades, and then gets to Zeke, slicing pieces of his body to bits, but not killing him. We are then thrown into a flashback arc of how Zeke comes to inherit the beast titan, turns in his anarchist parents to the government, and comes up with the euthanasia plan. After this arc, we see Zeke try to blow Levi and himself up, as either an escape attempt or to not let his powers fall into the hands of the scouts, and the scene ends with a titan picking up Zeke’s dismembered body and putting it into a hole in its stomach that it tore. I assume this titan to be Levi, as there were supposedly no others in the area after the retaking of wall Maria, and Levi killed his transformed comrades. So, by this theory, Levi now has the Beast Titan. This explains all the memes I saw of a short beast titan, as the beast titan is ridiculously tall while owned by Zeke, who is tall himself, but Levi is comparably quite short.</p>
                    <p>The show leaves us on a cliffhanger. Eren brings the cart titan shifter to the rooftop, and asks her to point out her comrades, “the enemy.” She turns to point at him, saying he’s the enemy, and as she does that, the jaw titan explodes through the floor and tries to eat Eren. It misses, and Eren transforms. The episode ends there, and we are left to wonder. So, how bad could the ending really be? Will Eren start the rumbling, the walk of thousands of titans that will trample a large portion of the world to dust? Will he fail all he wanted to do? What side will win? What sides even are there? Most groups are united by a select few things, but it’s more like a complex series of Venn diagrams than it is alliances. Also, on a note that doesn’t directly forward the plot, but provides an interesting story about morals and the teachings of history, we see the child who killed Sasha, Gabi, and her friend, Falco, be unknowingly brought in and cared for by Sasha’s own family. The whole family then goes to a restaurant to be served by a Marleyan chef who secretly had a crush on Sasha. This is when Gabi tells the chef, Nicolo, that she was the one to kill Sasha, and Nicolo loses it. He brings Gabi to the dining room with a knife, and Falco unconscious, and asks Sasha’s father if he wants to kill Gabi, or if Nicolo should himself. In the end, Gabi’s life is spared, but she can’t understand why, having been taught that these people are the devils, the worst people in existence.</p>
                    <p>Oh, I also forgot to mention the part where Eren has a meeting with Mikasa and Armin. He makes Mikasa cry and beats Armin to a pulp. There’s a lot of things I forgot to mention, but this one shows some important character development for Eren. Not sure what his deal is, but there are arguments from all sides of the fandom that he’s either the worst person ever or justified in his actions due to his past traumas. I think I’ll just leave this one alone though, as it seems like a lot to unpack, and is honestly the sort of thing one should form their own opinion of through watching the show themselves. It seems, though, that he doesn’t really have any friends left, and his allies really see him only as a means to an end. His situation looks meager, and his demise near. Now all I can do is wait and speculate. But considering Zeke is dead, either eaten by Levi or some other titan, the spinal wine can no longer hold the army hostage, and Eren and his force could be quickly overturned. But if Eren fails, and all Eldians are not euthanized, how will they find peace? Will they remain trapped within the walls, or what? I’m eager to find out, but also equally nervous to witness the ending that seems to be hated by so many people.</p>
