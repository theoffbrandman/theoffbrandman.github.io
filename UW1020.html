        <h1>Welcome to my UW 1020 Blog!</h1>
        <p>A blog for the fandom studies course</p>
        <h2>Blog Post #1 - My Introducation to Attack on Titan!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>Today, I started watching the anime series “Attack on Titan.” The fandom is huge, contains people with all different backgrounds and interests, and, most influential to my start of this journey, includes a large sum of my friends. I started where anyone would and should, with the first episode of the first season. It left me with many questions, not quite enough answers, and already an allegiance to the show. I’ll run through a quick summary of what I saw, noticed, and felt.</p>
        <p>Opening scene, I was immediately struck by the art. It was clean and detailed, yet mellow and somber. It depicted the green eye of what seems to be the main character, Eren, then switched to some geese flying overhead. Eventually, we pan to a massive, terrifying creature, known as a titan. It looks like a messed up, Halloween version of the human musculoskeletal system. We watch it try to break past the walls that surround the city in which the characters live in.</p>
        <p>Cut to Eren having a bad dream. He wakes up in a flower field, crying, and here we meet Mikasa, a girl about his same age. They were collecting kindling before Eren fell asleep. They begin the walk back to the walls, in which their village is contained. Mikasa tells Eren to tell his father about the fact that he was crying when he woke up, but Eren absolutely refuses, wanting to put up a strong front, a theme we see continued throughout the episode.</p>
        <p>The children get to the gate and come upon the soldiers in charge of protecting it, drinking and playing cards. This sets Eren off, and he starts arguing with them, saying they should do their job properly. He then begins talking about how the citizens of Shiganshina (the city in which AoT is set) live like livestock, cooped up for their entire lives, and how they should explore and see what’s out there more thoroughly. At this point, it is revealed that Eren wants to join the scout regiment, a group that does just that, but experiences many casualties.</p>
        <p>Our next scene is of the said scout regiment returning to town. Many are injured, hurt, or missing. A mother runs into the crowd, asking for her son. They hand her a severed arm, as it is all that is left. The rest of her son has been eaten by a titan. Here we learn that the purpose of the scout regiment is to do research outside of the walls, but they tend to be generally unsuccessful, and end up being mocked by the majority of the village. Some people in the back of the crowd begin to say disparaging things about the scouts, causing Eren to hit them with a piece of kindling. Eren is a frail child, though, so this does nothing but anger them. Mikasa, who seems very strong, drags Eren away before he gets beaten up.</p>
        <p>Now, the children are at home. We get to meet their mother and father, and see a calm, quiet, comfortable family life. That is, until Mikasa informs everyone of Eren’s intent to join the scout regiment. His mother begins to yell at him, equal parts furious and desperate for him not to. His father, a well-established doctor within the town, keeps a cool head, and talks with Eren about his motivations. The father then leaves for a business trip, stating he will return in a few days, and that he’ll show Eren what he’s been working on in the cellar, to which Eren lights up. His father then leaves, and immediately Eren’s mother tells him he is not allowed to join the regiment. He yells at her and runs away. The mother then tells Mikasa to look after him, and Mikasa begins pursuit.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the episode cuts to a blond boy by the name of Armin. He is getting pummeled for apparently stating some sacrilegious ideas, likely about leaving the walls. He refuses to hit back, as to not stoop to his attacker’s level. He lets them know this, and that only makes them angrier. As he is about to get hit again, Eren shows up, screaming. Armin’s assailants turn to him, with recognition, and look excited to beat him up as well. They see Mikasa in tail, though, and comedically turn and run.</p>
        <p>After things are sorted out, we see the children at the river, where Eren and Armin discuss what’s beyond the walls, annoying Mikasa. They talk about their worries, wondering if there will be a breakthrough, or some terrible event. Foreshadowing. A huge bolt of lightning and an explosion just outside of the gate. A massive titan, taller than the walls, appears, and kicks a hole clear through the defenses. Rocks fly, buildings fall, and there are various bloody, gory casualties. Terrified and dreadfully hopeful, Eren and Mikasa run home to see if their mother is alright. Armin is left behind. Eren turns the corner, and sees his house, destroyed. His mother is trapped under a beam, legs crushed, and the children cannot free her. She tells them to run, but they won’t.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a soldier shows up. His name is Hannes, the same one who was drunk at the gate. The mother tells him to take the kids and run, but he refuses, saying he’ll kill the titan that is currently coming for the family, and save them all, speaking of some sort of unpaid debt. He runs toward the monster, drawing his sword, but is stopped short. In an incredibly well animated scene, we see the titan turn to look at him. It is truly a terrifying creature. Hannes sheathes his sword, and doubles back. He grabs the children and takes them away. The mother thanks him, but, as she watches the children go, cries, covers her mouth, and says “don’t go.”</p>
        <p>Character backstory time. Eren turns back to look at his mother, and watches the titan pick her up, kill her, and bite her in half. We close on a scene of cloudy skies, with petals and puddles of blood floating across it in slow motion. The credits play, with a dark video and a somber song.</p>
        <p>Overall, the first episode was awesome. All this, crammed into 22 minutes. Incredible animation, diverse characters, a great balance between action, gore, and blood, and philosophy, family, and childhood. I can’t wait for episode two. It really lived up to, and even blew past, my expectations. The show is deep, intricate, and entertaining. I’m full of questions, but in a positive way that keeps me interested. My only qualm with it is how some parts seemed forced. It all happened so fast, and parts of the dialogue didn’t seem normal, as if they were forcing character names in, or random facts about the city, plot, or background. Honestly, though, this is to be expected with any show in its early developmental stages, so it didn’t bug me too much. Details must be established, so let’s get it over with and get into the show! I can’t decide if I enjoy Eren and his persistence, or if I despise him and his holier-than-thou, righteous attitude. Mikasa is awesome and level-headed though. I look forward to the next episode, and the next 3 seasons too.</p>
        <p>This first blog post is an exception. I am using it to establish the show, main points, and plot. In the following posts, my responses will likely range in a lower word count range, with around 300 words, and will focus on multiple episodes. But here, I was just so excited that I couldn’t stop myself from writing almost 2000 words about it. You should see the notes I took while I watched. Until next week!</p>
