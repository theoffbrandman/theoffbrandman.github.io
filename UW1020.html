        <h1>Welcome to my UW 1020 Blog!</h1>
        <p>A blog for the fandom studies course</p>
        <h2>Blog Post #1 - My Introducation to Attack on Titan!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>Today, I started watching the anime series “Attack on Titan.” The fandom is huge, contains people with all different backgrounds and interests, and, most influential to my start of this journey, includes a large sum of my friends. I started where anyone would and should, with the first episode of the first season. It left me with many questions, not quite enough answers, and already an allegiance to the show. I’ll run through a quick summary of what I saw, noticed, and felt.</p>
        <p>Opening scene, I was immediately struck by the art. It was clean and detailed, yet mellow and somber. It depicted the green eye of what seems to be the main character, Eren, then switched to some geese flying overhead. Eventually, we pan to a massive, terrifying creature, known as a titan. It looks like a messed up, Halloween version of the human musculoskeletal system. We watch it try to break past the walls that surround the city in which the characters live in.</p>
        <p>Cut to Eren having a bad dream. He wakes up in a flower field, crying, and here we meet Mikasa, a girl about his same age. They were collecting kindling before Eren fell asleep. They begin the walk back to the walls, in which their village is contained. Mikasa tells Eren to tell his father about the fact that he was crying when he woke up, but Eren absolutely refuses, wanting to put up a strong front, a theme we see continued throughout the episode.</p>
        <p>The children get to the gate and come upon the soldiers in charge of protecting it, drinking and playing cards. This sets Eren off, and he starts arguing with them, saying they should do their job properly. He then begins talking about how the citizens of Shiganshina (the city in which AoT is set) live like livestock, cooped up for their entire lives, and how they should explore and see what’s out there more thoroughly. At this point, it is revealed that Eren wants to join the scout regiment, a group that does just that, but experiences many casualties.</p>
        <p>Our next scene is of the said scout regiment returning to town. Many are injured, hurt, or missing. A mother runs into the crowd, asking for her son. They hand her a severed arm, as it is all that is left. The rest of her son has been eaten by a titan. Here we learn that the purpose of the scout regiment is to do research outside of the walls, but they tend to be generally unsuccessful, and end up being mocked by the majority of the village. Some people in the back of the crowd begin to say disparaging things about the scouts, causing Eren to hit them with a piece of kindling. Eren is a frail child, though, so this does nothing but anger them. Mikasa, who seems very strong, drags Eren away before he gets beaten up.</p>
        <p>Now, the children are at home. We get to meet their mother and father, and see a calm, quiet, comfortable family life. That is, until Mikasa informs everyone of Eren’s intent to join the scout regiment. His mother begins to yell at him, equal parts furious and desperate for him not to. His father, a well-established doctor within the town, keeps a cool head, and talks with Eren about his motivations. The father then leaves for a business trip, stating he will return in a few days, and that he’ll show Eren what he’s been working on in the cellar, to which Eren lights up. His father then leaves, and immediately Eren’s mother tells him he is not allowed to join the regiment. He yells at her and runs away. The mother then tells Mikasa to look after him, and Mikasa begins pursuit.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the episode cuts to a blond boy by the name of Armin. He is getting pummeled for apparently stating some sacrilegious ideas, likely about leaving the walls. He refuses to hit back, as to not stoop to his attacker’s level. He lets them know this, and that only makes them angrier. As he is about to get hit again, Eren shows up, screaming. Armin’s assailants turn to him, with recognition, and look excited to beat him up as well. They see Mikasa in tail, though, and comedically turn and run.</p>
        <p>After things are sorted out, we see the children at the river, where Eren and Armin discuss what’s beyond the walls, annoying Mikasa. They talk about their worries, wondering if there will be a breakthrough, or some terrible event. Foreshadowing. A huge bolt of lightning and an explosion just outside of the gate. A massive titan, taller than the walls, appears, and kicks a hole clear through the defenses. Rocks fly, buildings fall, and there are various bloody, gory casualties. Terrified and dreadfully hopeful, Eren and Mikasa run home to see if their mother is alright. Armin is left behind. Eren turns the corner, and sees his house, destroyed. His mother is trapped under a beam, legs crushed, and the children cannot free her. She tells them to run, but they won’t.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a soldier shows up. His name is Hannes, the same one who was drunk at the gate. The mother tells him to take the kids and run, but he refuses, saying he’ll kill the titan that is currently coming for the family, and save them all, speaking of some sort of unpaid debt. He runs toward the monster, drawing his sword, but is stopped short. In an incredibly well animated scene, we see the titan turn to look at him. It is truly a terrifying creature. Hannes sheathes his sword, and doubles back. He grabs the children and takes them away. The mother thanks him, but, as she watches the children go, cries, covers her mouth, and says “don’t go.”</p>
        <p>Character backstory time. Eren turns back to look at his mother, and watches the titan pick her up, kill her, and bite her in half. We close on a scene of cloudy skies, with petals and puddles of blood floating across it in slow motion. The credits play, with a dark video and a somber song.</p>
        <p>Overall, the first episode was awesome. All this, crammed into 22 minutes. Incredible animation, diverse characters, a great balance between action, gore, and blood, and philosophy, family, and childhood. I can’t wait for episode two. It really lived up to, and even blew past, my expectations. The show is deep, intricate, and entertaining. I’m full of questions, but in a positive way that keeps me interested. My only qualm with it is how some parts seemed forced. It all happened so fast, and parts of the dialogue didn’t seem normal, as if they were forcing character names in, or random facts about the city, plot, or background. Honestly, though, this is to be expected with any show in its early developmental stages, so it didn’t bug me too much. Details must be established, so let’s get it over with and get into the show! I can’t decide if I enjoy Eren and his persistence, or if I despise him and his holier-than-thou, righteous attitude. Mikasa is awesome and level-headed though. I look forward to the next episode, and the next 3 seasons too.</p>
        <p>This first blog post is an exception. I am using it to establish the show, main points, and plot. In the following posts, my responses will likely range in a lower word count range, with around 300 words, and will focus on multiple episodes. But here, I was just so excited that I couldn’t stop myself from writing almost 2000 words about it. You should see the notes I took while I watched. Until next week!</p>

        <h2>Blog Post #2 - The Fall of Shiganshina: Part 2</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>The second episode continues in a similar fashion. A somber, gory tone, filled with death and despair. We see the children whisked away to an inner wall on the boat, and many people are left behind. There are crazed people, running through the city, getting eaten, shouting prayers, or simply giving up. We see many soldiers desert their positions. They try and keep the original titan that broke in from continuing to breach barriers by closing a gate, but the titan simply gets a running start and blows through the wall, allowing all the smaller titans in. The large one does not seem to be interested in eating people, but only in making way for the smaller titans to wreak havoc. In the mess, approximately 10,000 lives are lost, and a famine is created by all the refugees. The refugees are disliked by the people living in the area, and the next year, 250,000 are sent off to war. Only a few hundred return, essentially wiping out half of the region’s population. It is a depressing fact, but it solves the food crisis. Armin’s grandfather dies in the war, leaving all three children with no family. I am not entirely sure about what happened to the father, other than the fact that Eren now has the key to the basement and has some strange flashback about begging his father not to inject him with something. In the end of the episode, we see Eren tell Armin and Mikasa that he will be entering Cadet training for the army. Armin says he will too, and Mikasa says she’ll join to protect Eren and make sure he survives.</p>
        <p>Overall, the show is both dystopian, set in a world completely different from ours, but also very familiar, exploring themes of hunger, strife, war, starvation, and refugee relations. It is both difficult to watch, and impossible to look away from. Continuing these blog posts, I will most likely begin to comment on three to four episodes at a time, as pausing the episodes and tearing myself away to take notes is proving to be much too difficult. It seems, though, that the characters, plot motivation, and overall tone of the show have been set in this two-part episode, so I expect there will be less details to nitpick over in the coming episodes. I can’t wait to continue watching!</p>

        <h2>Blog Post #3 - Episodes 3-6: Madness</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>For this week’s blog, I watched episodes 3 through 6 of the first season. Let me start by saying this: it was insane. The story moved along at a break-neck pace yet was also just perfectly slow enough to add in all the necessary details, stylistic elements, and character development. In the 4 episodes, we are introduced to an assortment of new characters, and soon afterward watch many of them get brutally murdered. We watch Eren, Mikasa, and Armin make their way through Cadet training, a training which Eren almost fails, until he realizes that he has been given faulty equipment to try and pass the exams. He makes it through in the top 5 in his class, with Mikasa in first place, and him in fifth. Armin seems to be somewhere in the top twenty, but we are not specifically told anything. The day after graduation, the colossal titan returns to knock down another wall. “Out of the frying pan, into the fire,” one character can be seen saying. It shows up, kicks a hole where the gate is, and right as Eren is heading towards the back of his neck to kill him, vanishes entirely. The episode goes on, and we see many of the cadets get murdered, grabbed right out of the air and eaten. Eren gets his leg bitten off while flying through the city, and lands on a rooftop, seemingly unable to move. Armin, at this sight, is petrified, and a titan picks him up, swallowing him whole. Eren manages to get back up, and, after a flashback about plans of seeing the outside world together with Armin, pries the mouth of the titan open. He pulls Eren out, and is promptly chomped down on by the titan, where we see his arm gruesomely fly off, the only thing that was outside of the titan’s jawline. Madness. Overall, though, the show is awesomely constructed. The development of characters is both deep and fast. The story has been explained, and shows a mixture of real-world fears and problems, along with whimsical fantasy elements. It is both gruesome and beautiful. It shows the close bonds between people, along with the delicate nature of life. One of the most important concepts the show incorporates is that of the fragility of the human mind. My favorite (yet also least favorite) character arc is between two recently graduated cadets who seem to have fallen deeply in love with each other. We watch them grow close, act sappy and childish, and progress in their military work. But, at some point, after Armin is pulled from the jaws of the titan by Eren, he comes upon the pair. The girl is desperately trying to give her lover CPR, but he simply won’t respond. Armin begs her to stop, but she won’t listen. The camera slowly cuts and pans, until the audience is allowed to indirectly realize that the man is missing the lower half of his body, entirely. This theme is a constant so far, as we watch various people fall into voids of despair and pits on insanity. Some are pulled from it by friends or fellow army-members. Some never make it out, and die, petrified before a titan, which proceeds to eat them. Here, and likely for the remainder of my blogging about the show, I will place a large emphasis on this concept. Most anime I have watched put the main characters in godlike positions, with unbreakable minds and unstoppable wills, completely ignoring the actual condition of the human mind. Attack on Titan’s portrayal about how easily humans can be broken, caused to struggle in helpless desperation over an impossible task, is serene, undisturbed, and unrivalled. It is one of the few productions that I have seen do such an incredible job at expressing a sensation that so many have felt yet is so often thrown to the curb in cinema. Astonishingly twisted, yet brutally accurate. I am simultaneously excited and terrified to continue watching, but I know I won’t be able to peel myself from it until the very end.</p>

        <h2>Blog Post #4 - Episodes 7-11: The Battle of Trost</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>As I continue watching Attack on Titan, I notice that its structure revolves around parts that neatly confine specific story arcs to various events, such as battles, backstories, or summaries. For instance, the show starts with a short, 2-part arc, introducing the characters and their stories, along with the world and the titan attacks. They then hold another arc, which constitutes cadet training and graduation. This transitions into a 9-episode arc, named “The Battle of Trost,” with Trost being a city that has been broken into by the colossal Titan once again, in the same way that was done to Eren, Mikasa, and Armin’s home city. The Trost arc, as I will call it, begins curiously. The cadets, now graduated, must fight off a horrific invasion right out of training. Many of them die almost immediately. There is a rally of courage on the rooftops, where the show draws on a very common anime trope that goes something like this: characters down on their luck, losing badly, main character gives heroic, motivational speech that inspires everyone, as speech ends, epic music begins to play, the crowd heads out, and in an incredibly awesome montage, the characters fight back, stronger than before, and come out victorious. However, if there is anything I have learned in the few episodes of AoT that I have watched, this seems unlikely, and how right I was. The characters get no more than one minute into their grand fight scene when they start getting brutally grabbed from the rooftops or yanked from the cables which they use to swing around and are brutally torn to shreds and eaten. This is around the point at which I left off last time, with Eren saving Armin and getting eaten, but I had to summarize what I previously watched to emphasize the organization of the show, along with the brutal rejections of the most common cliches and tropes of general anime. It was both bewildering and expected, at least knowing what I did as about the AoT fandom and their conversations about the matter. But as the arc carries on, we see a familiar theme, centered around, of course, our main character Eren.</p>
        <p>Eren can transform into a titan. There, it’s out of the bag. Now to discuss it. This theme is a near constant in any anime that contains fighting, especially against a formidable opponent which the characters seem to have no chance of beating. It is the specific principle that, in the face of death or defeat, the main character suddenly gains some incredible power, usually from rage, spite, or sadness. In AoT, we see Eren freak out in the stomach of a titan and transform into one himself out of fear and rage. He goes on a rampage, killing as many other titans as he can, and helps the remaining soldiers retake the supply tower. Nobody realizes that it’s him though, only knowing that it is a titan with no interest in killing humans, but only hunts other titans, which is completely unheard of. They only discover it’s him when the titan seemingly runs out of energy, falls on its face, and, as it decays into steam (which is what titans do when they die), he sits up out of it. Mikasa rushes down to embrace him. To summarize the events that happen after this, we see Eren use his power to protect Armin and Mikasa when a canon is shot at the three for treason, as the unit commander believes Eren wants to kill everyone, and his friends are committing treason by protecting him. We see the Military General of the south walls, Pyxis, show up and put a stop to this. Eventually, a plan is hatched to have Eren seal up the wall in titan form by picking up and carrying a huge boulder and placing it into the hole that the colossal titan created. Once again, the show harps on the mental fragility of humans, showing depictions of people who do not want to fight a battle alongside a titan trying to desert. Some are told they will be killed for deserting and say they would prefer it to dying in battle. Some even try to commit suicide. Pyxis eventually gives a speech, causing many soldiers to change their minds and fight. When Eren transforms into a titan, though, we see him try to kill Mikasa. Armin snaps him out of it by reminding him what the future holds, along with stabbing him, and, after mass casualties, the hole is sealed. It is the first time the humans have ever won a battle against the titans, as opposed to suffering pointless casualties.</p>
        <p>Looking back at these few episodes, and this blog post so far, I realize how much has been covered, and how much I have left out. The show moves at a truly incredible speed, yet fits in a fantastic amount of detail, with never a dull moment, yet never a moment misunderstood, either. The creators accept tropes, reject others, and have created a true masterpiece, worthy of a fandom as loyal as the one it has. I believe that the topic of my term paper on this anime will be something about mental health and the anime fandom, as it is generally a large issue among fans, but largely ignored by anime and the producers of such. And, to end this post with one final topic, I must talk about the happenings inside the gas resupply tower. Gas is needed for the soldiers to swing around on their mobility gear. The resupply room has been overtaken by titans, though, and the resupply workers gave up, leaving many soldiers out of gas and near death due to this. A look inside the resupply tower under siege tells a story. We see four remaining soldiers barricaded in a room. Three are freaking out, terrified of death, two men and two women. One, though, is calmly loading a shotgun. He finishes loading it, and one of the women freaking out turns to tell him that it won’t do anything to the titans. Without so much as a glance, he puts the barrel in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The camera immediately cuts to the woman who was just talking to him, and we see his blood splatter on her face, right before we cut back to the soldiers outside. It is a heavy scene. It is a lot to process, but, in a production such as AoT, a completely necessary depiction of the human mind at its simplest yet most complex level. Until next week.</p>

        <h2>Blog Post #5 - Episodes 12-18: Eve of the Counterattack and Female Titan</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>Trost has been recaptured, and the first victory the humans have ever had over the titans is accomplished, despite many casualties. We see the characters recuperate, and, just as it is with real wars, they are launched into the next series of events. There is a dramatic ceremony where some are induced into the scout regiment, while others turn their back in fear and run away from the idea of a likely death. Pretty reasonable if you ask me. A counterattack is immediately launched, where the characters attempt to retake wall Maria, the wall first lost in the beginning of the series, where we see the death of Eren’s mother. They venture out into the ruins of the past city, and we see the complex system of signaling flares they use to evade titans while on horseback. We see how they bring down the monsters without the aid of large structures to assist them in getting higher ground, and how they prioritize certain sectors of the troops using formations and communications. Everything seems to be going much better in terms of killing titans than in the beginning of the show, with almost no deaths, thanks to the work of the highly trained veteran scouts. They even succeed at taking out some abnormal monsters, until we meet a new titan, the first one to express female characteristics. It destroys many and seems to tear through the ranks with little to no regard for the people trying to attack it, as if searching for someone. It also appears to have the rationality to cover the nape of its neck, its weak point. Armin is attacked by it, but when the female titan sees his face, he is sparred for some odd reason. And, by the way, the title of the episode is quite literally “Female Titan,” placing an interesting emphasis on the fact that all the titans we have seen previously are male, which I may talk about at some point later in the future. Armin begins to theorize that, like Eren and his titan form, the female titan is controlled by a person, which would explain its seemingly intelligent nature. We see this titan take out the entire right wing and, therefore, their recon and signaling capabilities, meaning no one else within the ranks is aware of its presence.</p>
        <p>But this section of the season deals heavily in character introductions of non-titans too. Through Eren’s acceptance into the scout regiment, we meet a whole new crew of people who are thought to be some of the most advanced titan hunters in existence, only surpassed by Mikasa and the leader of the group, as far as we know. They seem to be a jovial bunch yet remain incredibly serious under battle conditions. The leader of the group, named Levi, seems to be quite the important figure, always keeping a level head, being quite analytical, yet also incredibly powerful and precise when it comes to killing titans and giving orders. We are also introduced to a scout member who works specifically with titans in terms of research and discovery, who talked to Eren briefly earlier in the series, but we were not given the chance to fully meet. She deals with captured titans, running various tests on them, seeing what affects them, how to hinder them, and various other things. Definitely, though, we are given a mad scientist depiction of her and her interactions with the titans she studies. She seems to harbor a deep care for them, screaming about the empathetic pain she feels when stabbing them with spears and various other things she must do in the name of research. One of the major developments within the story is when the two titans she is studying are killed by some unseen infiltrator. This causes her to break down and leads to an inspection of the battle equipment of every single person who could have possibly been involved.</p>
        <p>I stopped watching at a tense point, but I look forward to the season finale. My next blog post will include the last episodes, for which I have no idea what to expect, other than cliffhangers. I can only imagine how the scout regiment will continue their journey, or who the person controlling the female titan will end up being. I am currently running through every blond female character in the show coming up with conspiracies and explanations. I look forward to the development of the new characters, and perhaps a discussion of gender representation so far in the series, between Mikasa, our newfound mad scientist, and the first-seen female titan. But then again, by the time I get around to my next blog post, they could each be dead, so no promises! Until next Sunday.</p>

        <h2>Blog Post #6 - Episodes 19-25: End of Season 1</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>The end of the first season is upon us, and not without drama. Getting right back into where we left off, the female titan continues to wreak havoc. By this point, the general of the scout division, Erwin, has decided to take a turn through a thick forest to bolster the capabilities of the omni-directional mobility equipment, or ODMs, as the soldiers can now grapple between the massive trees. At this point, it has been made clear that the female titan’s goal has something to do with Eren. We see her chase Eren, Levi, and Levi’s team as they run on horseback. We watch as various other soldiers are mauled and murdered during the female titan’s pursuit, and Eren chooses to trust Erwin and allow this to continue for the sake of some plan that he cannot be told about. They lead the female titan into a trap and capture her by an intricate net of spears and cables shot into her body. However, they are unable to cut out the person inside due to the titan’s unprecedented ability to harden her skin, so it breaks the swords of the soldiers. In a grandiose escape, the female titan lets out a giant roar alerting other titans to her location. The other titans swarm the area and begin to tear her body apart. When the smoke of her decaying body clears, the operator is nowhere to be seen, until we realize there is a strange, new, hooded scout swinging through the forest. This new scout goes after Eren, and one of the members of Levi’s elite titan killing squad dies protecting Eren from the mysterious figure. Levi is, at this point in the story, separated from Eren and his squad, due to various orders from Erwin. The mysterious scout then transforms into the female titan and continues after Eren. The remaining members of Levi’s squad attempt to continue to protect Eren but are horrifyingly dispatched, one by one, as Eren watches. At the sight of this, Eren transforms into a titan himself and fights her. He loses and is swallowed by the female titan. She runs off with him in her mouth, but Levi and Mikasa give chase, eventually bringing her to a stop, cutting Eren out of her mouth, and, by Erwin’s orders, retreat home. The loses are major, and the success is minimal.</p>
        <p>As our soldiers return home, we transition into the next arc, seeing a dismal reception from the village, and the orders that Eren must be turned over to the military police, likely for a death sentence. We see an incredibly intricate plan, though, hatched by Armin, our resident genius. A close friend takes Eren’s place in the guarded cab, and they recruit Annie, a military police officer and past friend from their group in cadet training, to assist. She says yes, and they lead her through an intricate passage to escape the city. She gets to the entrance of an underground tunnel, and for some reason, refuses to go any further. At this point, I connect the painfully obvious dots. Annie is female, blond, has incredible combat skills, placed very highly in her graduating class, and is almost definitely the female titan. They attempt to ambush her, but she turns into the female titan and begins trying to kill Eren, having seemingly given up on the idea of capturing him. After massive destruction, a failed escape attempt, and a near death experience, Eren is also able to transform into a titan and fight back. They are relatively evenly matched, until Eren unlocks a special ability, and literally heats up, turning black and orange. He begins to destroy Annie, and we see her try to escape by hardening her fingers and climbing the wall. Her face is, at this point, very disfigured, looking both terrifying and terrified. Mikasa meets her halfway, though, and, after an epic one-liner, cuts off Annie’s fingers, leaving her to fall back to Eren. Eren tears her to shreds, and nearly kills her, but stops short when he sees Annie’s actual face. In Eren’s split second of hesitation, Annie, who is having a continuous series of flashbacks about how she must return and see her father one last time, engulfs herself in a cocoon of the semi-translucent material that breaks swords. She is no longer in titan form, having been torn from it be Eren, and is simply laying in the shell wearing her military uniform, in a comatose state. This all transpires in the capital of the centermost wall and is witnessed by the highest echelons of society. As the final episode ends, we see a portion of the wall crumble where Annie had put her hand and broken through. Behind the portion, inside the wall, is the terrifying face of a titan. A painful cliffhanger.</p>
        <p>This has been a huge summary, and I left out quite a lot for the sake of it being a summary, but I could not look away for a moment. I am so incredibly excited to begin the second season. To revisit my previous posts, I must reiterate the incredible depictions of the fragility of humans as a species that this show incorporates. It is revisited time and time again, each instance as meaningful as the last. Whether it be immobility from fear, unbridled rage after witnessing the death of close ones, or suicide as a means of escape from the all too painful future, there is no filter placed on the reality of the situation and the people in it, as is so often done with anime. Now, in terms of gender representation, the show does a curious job. For instance, in the manga, Mikasa is apparently given a personality that extends beyond Eren’s faithful bodyguard. She has a sense of humor, among other things, and many have a problem with her stoic animated version. I have yet to read the manga, but once I do, I plan to expand on this concept. On the other hand, one of the show’s first well-known major antagonists and plot twists is, and revolves around, Annie. She is a strong, independent, and terrifying woman, something that is not represented all too well across mainstream animation. She begins seemingly as a side character, but is given some thought-provoking depth and unknown motives, and becomes an incredibly important figure in the general plot. Another case to look at is Levi’s elite squad before they are wiped out. One of the four members is a young woman named Petra. She, like Annie, is incredibly good at what she does, having worked hard to get to where she is, and has a diverse and strong skillset. Unfortunately, like many of the other characters, she was never given the chance for character development.</p>
        <p>As an update to my previous post, after looking at the wiki, I realize our mad scientist, named Hange, is apparently ambiguous in gender. The inclusion of a non-binary character is an important realization, and something I will also discuss in a future post. I ended up calling Hange by she/her pronouns in the previous blog post due to what I chalk up to an error in translation from Japanese audio to English subtitles. Perhaps the loss in translation from manga to anime, anime to subtitles, and subtitles to dubbing is another conversation I should consider blogging about in the future, but I will wait until Hange is given some more background and action. I will continue to do my best to avoid mistakes like these in the future and do some additional research into character backgrounds using the fandom wiki going forward. Until next season!</p>
